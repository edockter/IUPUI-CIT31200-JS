#CIT 31200
##Exercise: JavaScript Practice

###What’s the Big Idea?
Some students will have experience using JavaScript.  It may be completely new to others.  This is your opportunity to refresh your knowledge of JavaScript by using the language to interact with HTML by way of some practice exercises.

###Instructions
You’ve been given three links to JavaScript exercises on JSBin.com 

**FOR EACH EXERCISE**, write the JavaScript in the JavaScript panel that accomplishes the tasks laid out for you in the comments.  Except where noted, you should not need to edit the HTML or CSS.
Please note the links to these files are located along with examples that should help get you going on a separate page called "Unit 2 Week 7 Exercise File Links" in this module.

You should see the JavaScript take effect in the Output panel immediately.  If the Output panel does not behave as expected, you may open the Console panel to see any error messages.
You can also use the JavaScript console.log() command to output information to the Console panel to assist you in your debugging.
When you have completed each exercise in JSBin, you MUST choose File > Download… in the JSBin menu to save your work in an HTML file.

###Submitting Your Work 
To submit, attach THREE HTML files (one for each exercise) to the Assignment page.  If you chose to create a JSBin.com account you may also provide links to your bins but you MUST ALSO attach the HTML files.
Assignments are due at 11:59pm on the due date listed.
