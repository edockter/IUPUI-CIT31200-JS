#CIT 31200
##Exercise: Javascript Events

###What’s the Big Idea?
The JavaScript you have written thus far executes as soon as the web page loads.  However, most JavaScript is triggered by an event (a user click or a page scroll, for example.)  Attaching an event listener to an HTML element is one of the most fundamental practices in JavaScript.

###Instructions
You’ve been given a link to a JavaScript exercise on JSBin.com 
Write the JavaScript in the JavaScript panel that accomplishes the tasks laid out for you in the comments.  Except where noted, you should not need to edit the HTML or CSS.
You should see the JavaScript take effect in the Output panel immediately.  If the Output panel does not behave as expected, you may open the Console panel to see any error messages.
You can also use the JavaScript console.log() command to output information to the Console panel to assist you in your debugging.
When you have completed the exercise in JSBin, you MUST choose File > Download… in the JSBin menu to save your work in an HTML file.

###Submitting Your Work
To submit, attach the HTML file to the Assignment page.  If you chose to create a JSBin.com account you may also provide a link to your bin but you MUST ALSO attach the HTML file.
Assignments are due at 11:59pm on the due date listed.
