###What’s the Big Idea?
Given a basic HTML/CSS website.  You must add JavaScript to give the site some advanced functionality.

###Instructions

**USING JAVASCRIPT** (plain JavaScript - no frameworks!), add the following functionality:
+ On the home page of the site you see a single promo banner and four promo buttons.  In the HTML source code there are three additional promo banners.  Using JavaScript, create event listeners that respond to a click of one of the promo buttons.  When a button is clicked, display the appropriate promo banner on the screen.
